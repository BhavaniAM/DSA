<h1> Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from a given vertex </h1>

<b> <h3> Input:- </h3> </b>
Each line has 3 numbers representing an directed edge between 2 vertices and a weight for that edge.

There are no repeated edges.

<b> <h3> Output:- </h3> </b>
Each line has 2 integers which represent the vertex to which the distance is being found and the distance from the source to that vertex.

<b> <h3> Commands to execute the code on Colab:- </h3> </b>
