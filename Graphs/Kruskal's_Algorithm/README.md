<h1> Kruskal's Algorithm to generate the Minimum Spanning Tree </h1>

<b> <h3> Input:- </h3> </b>
Each line has 3 numbers representing an undirected edge between 2 vertices and a weight for that edge.

There are no repeated edges.

<b> <h3> Output:- </h3> </b>
Each line has 3 integers which represent the 2 vertices forming the edge and the weight for that edge.

<b> <h3> Commands to execute the code on Colab:- </h3> </b>
